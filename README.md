# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes based on patient data. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms in Python to build a predictive model.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on diagnostic measurements such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Name of Dataset, e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Database]. It contains [Number] instances and [Number] features. [Optional: Briefly describe the dataset's source or key characteristics].

## Code and Libraries

The project is implemented in Python using the following key libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
*   **scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, model training, and evaluation.
*   **matplotlib/seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
*   `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its characteristics, identify missing values, and perform basic statistical analysis.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values (if any), scaling features, and encoding categorical variables (if applicable).
3.  **Model Training:** Several machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data, including [List Algorithms Used, e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest].
4.  **Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
5.  **Visualization:** Data visualization techniques are used to explore the data and visualize model performance.

## Results

[Optional: Briefly summarize the key results of the project, e.g., "The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of X% on the test set."]
